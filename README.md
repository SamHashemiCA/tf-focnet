# TensorFlow implementation of the FocNet

The FocNet is a network introduced by Xixi Jia et al. in
"Focnet: A fractional optimal control network for image denoising", CVPR 2019.
If you use this network, please cite their work appropriately.

The official implementation is available [here](https://github.com/hsijiaxidian/FOCNet)
in Matlab.

The goal of this implementation in TensorFlow is to be easy to read and to adapt:
- all the code is in one file
- defaults are those from the paper
- there is no other imports than from TensorFlow
